# Lesson 12: React Hooks and TypeScript

## Overview

In this lesson, we learn how to use React hooks with TypeScript. We cover the following hooks: `useState`, `useEffect`, `useCallback`, `useMemo`, and `useRef`. TypeScript is used to define types for state, functions, and references, providing type safety and improved maintainability.

## Key Concepts

- **useState**: Manages component state with explicit types.
- **useEffect**: Handles side effects, like fetching data or logging, and can run on mount, unmount, or when specific dependencies change.
- **useRef**: Creates a persistent reference to a DOM element or value without triggering re-renders.
- **useCallback**: Memoizes functions to prevent unnecessary re-creations, improving performance.
- **useMemo**: Memoizes computed values, recalculating them only when dependencies change, optimizing expensive calculations.

## Conclusion

This lesson demonstrates how React hooks integrate with TypeScript to build type-safe and efficient React components. By using hooks effectively, we can manage state, side effects, and optimize performance in our applications.
